This project is a secure RESTful API built with Spring Boot, providing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing resources such as users, products, or custom entities.
It implements JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to ensure secure access to protected endpoints, enabling role-based authorization and stateless session management.
